## React Redux Image Carousel!

This is an application that will utilize the fullstack.  More importantly it will use React, Redux & SAGA to build an image carousel from scratch. 

The application will display images on the DOM with a next and previous button. These button will be able to loop through the images we have in the database. There will â€¨be a select drop down that will indicate how a user feels. Once selected the user can apply the feeling and it will display on the DOM. When refreshed the DOM will still show
The feeling. All images and tag data will be utilized from the Database.
